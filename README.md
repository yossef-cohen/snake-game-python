# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implementation using Python's Turtle graphics library.

## Files

The project consists of five files:

1. `main.py`: The main game loop and setup
2. `Snake.py`: Defines the Snake class
3. `food.py`: Defines the Food class
4. `scoreboard.py`: Defines the Scoreboard class (not provided in the given files, but referenced in the code)
5. `data.txt`: Stores the high score

## How to Play

1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. Control the snake using either the arrow keys or WASD keys.
3. Eat the red food to grow and increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself.

## Game Features

- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- The score increases with each food eaten.
- The game keeps track of the high score between sessions.
- The snake and score reset when the game ends, but the high score is preserved.

## Dependencies

This game requires Python 3 and the Turtle graphics library, which comes pre-installed with Python.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Download all five files (`main.py`, `Snake.py`, `food.py`, `scoreboard.py`, and `data.txt`) into the same directory.
3. Run `main.py` using Python to start the game.
